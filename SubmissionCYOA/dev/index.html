        You awaken, confused.<br><br>
        You try to blink, only to find that you cannot. You look around, but cannot even see your own body when you look down oddly enough.<br><br>
        Very quickly you realize you have no body at all. you cannot even speak. A moment's thought has you realize that even your memories seem quite fuzzy.<br><br>
        Strangely enough, all of this has you quite unconcerned.

        "Ah. Awake now are you?
        </p>
        <p>
        You turn at the voice, finding a woman to have suddenly appeared.<br><br>
        The first thing you notice is her beautiful appearance, easily the most attractive woman you've ever seen.<br><br>
        The second thing you see is her form of dress, or lack thereof. Just bits of latex and leather like she had just walked out of a sex shop.<br><br>
        Belatedly your vision finally catches on the pair of jet black wings extending from her back.<br><br>
        Her lips curl into a smirk as if she notices you checking her out. You are not quite sure how that would even work given your current lack of physical form.
        </p>
        <p class="guideSpeech">
        "Welcome."
        </p>
        <p>
        Her wings flare out a bit with her declaration.

        <p class="guideSpeech">
        "I'm sure you must be quite confused right now. Most people are when the first arrive here."
        <span class="normalText">Her lips twitch a bit.</span>
        "It's why you now all start in that calm state you're feeling right now."
        </p>
        <p>
        Everything up to this point has been quite bizarre, with the waking up in an indistinct area, without a body and barely any memories.<br><br>
        Then this supernaturally beautiful woman appeared, with wings of all things on her back. Something in the back of your mind starts niggling at you about this scenario.<br><br>
        Your eyes lock back on her as she begins to move. You trace the sensual movements of her body, as she seemingly settles in to make herself comfortable before continuing.

        </p>
        <p>
        You nod. Or try to anyway.<br><br>
        "Another world" or "isekai" genre stories have become quite popular as of late, you manage to recall hazily.<br><br>
        The first thing to come to mind is stories of people being summoned as heroes. A life of adventure, full of might and magic. Is that what awaits you?
        </p>
        <p class="guideSpeech">
        "Ahahaha!"
        <span class="normalText">She immediately lets out a burst of laughter, amusement clear on her face. It takes a moment for her to regain control, such is the level of the hilarity she apparently felt.</span>

        </p>
        <p>
        Well, you pause to consider, apparently unbothered by being laughed at.<br><br>
        Though less common there were certainly other isekai stories as well. Slice of life, or romance.
        </p>
        <p class="guideSpeech">
        "Close!"

        <span class="normalText">A condescending look is given to you as she continues speaking,</span>
        "The only reason you would be here in the first place, the only reason you would still be here now, is if on some level you were interested in such matters."
        </p>
        <p>
        You watch transfixed as she lifts into the air with a single flap of her wings,
        floating effortlessly aftewards with no further movement.<br><br>
        Her body twists, offering you a prime view of her assets as he grins at you lasciviously.

        <p>
        Chuckling again, she rights herself, landing on the ground once more.<br><br>
        You pause to consider her words, and have to admit that the thought does make you feel a little flushed.

          You have retained the new body you were given, along with all the physical and mental modifications made to it,
          minus those that were merely conditions and orders set by your master while you lived with them.
          All evidence, history, and even the memories of those around you have shifted to adjust to your new form,
          as if you have always been this way. Though your past has only altered slightly to accomodate the changes,
          Do not expect people's attitudes and behavior towards you to remain static with time though as you are now
          likely a very different person now compared to before.<br><br>
          This option only has a base payout of $6000 per month, but each leftover point is a 2% bonus to your total.
          Consider it an incentive for a more interesting body to take back with you.<br><br>

          You have elected to stay.<br><br>

          Any money you would have earned will be given to your master instead.

          Your master has grown tired of you.
          When your time was up, your master sold you away as a sex slave to the highest bidder.
          But you have become used to this sort of life, and elected not to return home, going with the flow.
          Your number of months no longer matters, as you will be a sex slave for far longer than just that.<br><br>
          Already used goods, not wanted even by your custom chosen master, you will never find a stable hom again.
          Prepare to live a life passed from the hands of one person to another like property,
          and equally used like you are just an object.<br><br>
          You will receive no payment with this ending. Property has no need for money.<br><br>
